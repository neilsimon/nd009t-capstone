# nd009t-capstone project

This is a project submission for my machine learning nano degree. The project centred around using clustering and cluster trained predictors to predict the price of gold using historical technical information about the price of gold and the S&P 500 index. Ultimately I have determined that none of the configurations resulted in a system capable of predicting the future value of gold with any significant degree of accuracy and so this does not challenge the efficient market hypothesis. That said, the novel approach to predicting, along with some possibly useful results means that I feel this avenue might have some merit both in the field of price and market prediction and in other fields.
